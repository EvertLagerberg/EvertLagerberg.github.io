I have bachelor in Media Technology at KTH, Stockholm. I am currently studying a master program in
Human Computer Interaction. It is a program about designing interaction and user experiences. That includes interaction through web interfaces but also interaction with other input/feedback modalities such as haptic, audio and so on. User research is also a big part of the program to find out user needs and to validate prototypes.
