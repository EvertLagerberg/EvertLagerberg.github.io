This projects examines the possibility of combining eye-tracking and speech recognition as input modalities for a vocabulary learning application. In order to do this, a high fidelity prototype was developed in Processing, integrating input from a Tobii Eye Tracker and microphone. The functionality of the prototype was evaluated in a user study.
