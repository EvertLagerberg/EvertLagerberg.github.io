title: Let's Go

Hi, I am Evert and I study Media Technology at KTH in Stockholm. I´m now in my fourth year and starting my masters in Human-Computer Interaction. To put use to what I’ve learned so far, I am starting to do some simple programming outside of school. This blog will be sort of a daily diary of what I am programming and learning, mostly just for myself. 

Right now I am trying to learn Ruby on Rails and LaTeX, so posts will be mostly about that.
