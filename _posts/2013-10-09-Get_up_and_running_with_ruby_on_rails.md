title: Get up and running with ruby on rails
---

I first started out using ruby on rails earlier this year and it was a real hassle to get it all working. This post is a collection of guides and tutorials I have found helpful.

This time around on another computer it was easier since i knew how to do it. Here are some tips for setting up ruby on rails on OS X Mountain Lion.

Start with getting Xcode, Homebrew, RVM and finally lastest versions of both ruby and rails.
I used this [guide](http://www.interworks.com/blogs/ckaukis/2013/03/05/installing-ruby-200-rvm-and-homebrew-mac-os-x-108-mountain-lion).

Next, get TextMate. Its a great editor for working with Ruby on Rails. Here is a good [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIKqgT-pEJA) on how create your first RoR-app and open it as a project in Textmate.

Next step, install Git. Git and Github are useful tools for back up you project as you progress. Its even more useful if you are more then one person working on the code. Follow the "Step 4 Install Git" in this [tutorial](http://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac).

Next step, read section 1.3 in this online [book](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book#sec-version_control) on how to set up Git and GitHub.

Pow is great Rack server that you can use to test out your applications locally and its super easy to set up. Got to [http://pow.cx/](http://pow.cx/) and scroll to the bottom of the page to find instruction on how you set it up in less then a minute!

I went back and re-did some of the popular web tutorials for ruby on rails that are out there.

[http://tryruby.org](http://tryruby.org)
A tutorial for the syntax in ruby. You dont need to know any programming at all for this. For me it was a bit to basic...

[http://railsforzombies.org](http://railsforzombies.org)
Super useful tutorial that explains the model, controller, view - structure of ruby on rails with video lectures and exercises. Recommended!
