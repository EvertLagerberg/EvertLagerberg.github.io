title: Trying out blender
---

In the coming days I will be working on a 3D modeling and Unity project for a course in Computer Graphics and Interaction. I will be using a method where you start modeling by placing a 2D photo as background and then drawing using that to set the points and lines of a 3D model.
This method was recommended by my teacher and the  [video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJJRC2ebvSE) he referred to, used Blender as a modeling environment. I have previously only used Maya, so I wanted to do a tutorial of some sort understand the interface and work process in Blender. I downloaded Blender and followed a tutorial to create a simple cup model.

I followed this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y__uzGKmxt8) to do the cup 
Im ok with the result. The handle was a little long/big maybe....but for a first try I am pretty happy!

As for Blender i thought it was a really great tool! I liked it a lot more than Maya(as of now) so happy I made the switch.
