title: 3D Modeling project part 1 Blender
---

My teacher had told me that he and his team were interested in 3D models of objects and building on the KTH Campus. Since my project would be kind of small and simple I chose to model a trashbin :). This is the photo that i took! It was very snowy, so picture could definitely have been better! Especially if I wanted to make textures tiles from the photo. However, later I came to the conclusion that materials might actually look better for the kind of very smooth painted surface of the trashbin.

Now I was ready to start modelling!
First i loaded in a front photo of the trash bin in Blender as background, moved it slightly to the side and then started to try to make the starting cube object of blender look like the trashbin form.

Since the trash bin i very symmetrical. I had great help from the  Loop Cut tool in blender. The Cut Tool basically creates new subareas (edges and faces) on the object. But what is great about it, is that it makes these sub dividings symmetrically all around the object. So for example, when i sliced  up a hole for the opening on the trash bin, the same opening was there to but cut opened on the opposite side.

I cut open four holes in the top of the object for the holes and dragged the side of the opening slightly inwards. I also rounded the roof of the trash bin.

Then i worked with the two golden parts of the form. There are two parts of the trash bin where the shape is shaped in three lines of golden bands. I had to extend and intended the surface and the round all parts.

I also added a rectangle on each side of the trash bin. I don't know that function it has, but it is there on the real trash bin so I wanted to add it.

Now I had my model ready and done!

Next up I wanted to add the green and gold textures of the trash bin. I found it quite hard to work with textures for this material since it does not really have much of a texture. It is smooth painted metal. This was easier to make with materials and lightning. I experimented with different materials and adding lightning and thought the result was quite good.

My modelling of the trash bin was finished!
