title: 3D Modeling project part 1: Blender
---
My teacher had told me that he and his team were interested in 3D models of objects and building on the KTH Campus. Since my project would be kind of small and simple I chose to model a trashbin :). This is the photo that i took! It was very snowy, so picture could definitely have been better! Especially if I wanted to make textures tiles from the photo. However, later I came to the conclusion that materials might actually look better for the kind of very smooth painted surface of the trashbin.

Now I was ready to start modelling!
First i loaded in a front photo of the trash bin in Blender as background, moved it slightly to the side and then started to try to make the starting cube object of blender look like the trashbin form.

Since the trash bin i very symmetrical. I had great help from the  Loop Cut tool in blender. The Cut Tool basically creates new subareas (edges and faces) on the object. But what is great about it, is that it makes these sub dividings symmetrically all around the object. So for example, when i sliced  up a hole for the opening on the trash bin, the same opening was there to but cut opened on the opposite side.
