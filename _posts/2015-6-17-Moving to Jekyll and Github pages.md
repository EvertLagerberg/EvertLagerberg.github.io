title: Moving to Jekyll and Github pages!
---

I decided to move my blog from Blogger to using Jekyll to generate my blog at Github Pages.

Blogging with Jekyll is different from using Blogger or any other CMS. There are literally hundreds of articles online describing the benefits of using Jekyll and how to make the switch.

I never really liked Blogger and I am also planning to build a portfolio website to go along with the blog so this will be the start of that project as well.

Ok lets go!
